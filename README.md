# Chat system
This is the final project for ICSDS @ NYU Shanghai, a chat system with GUI and Pygame. 

Authors: Ben Cheung bc3431, Ruofan Wang rw3232.

## Running the chat system
First, run 
```
python chat_server.py
```
to start the server. For some reason I had some issues with the 'requests' module, if you encounter this error as well use the run button in vscode.

Then, run 
```
python chat_cmdl_client.py
```
to open a new instance of the client. You can do this however many times to open a new client.


## GUI TODO
- [x] add login and sign up page
- [x] messages always display on new line
- [x] talk with a chatbot using RapidAPI
- [ ] make login and sign up page look better
- [ ] customized chat window
